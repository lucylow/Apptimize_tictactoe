# Tic Tac Toe

Coding challenge where I had to **integrate a mobile application with the Apptimize SDK**. **I created a basic tic tac toe game with Swift and XCode** and then followed the documentation from [Apptimize SDK Download and Documentation](https://apptimize.com/docs/sdk-information.html). 

Decided to use Apptimize to run an experiment to see whether **users like a blue (original) or black (variant) background**. To do this, I started by adding the SDK to my native iOS project. From there, results were then sent to the Apptimize dashboard, where I'll be able to **determine which option ended up a user favourite based on user retention and engagement**.
