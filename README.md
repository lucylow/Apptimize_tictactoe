# Tic Tac Toe

This was a coding challenge where I had to integrate a mobile application with the Apptimize SDK. Created a basic tic tac toe game with Swift and XCode. 

Decided to use Apptimize to run an experiment to see whether **users like a blue (original) or black (variant) background**. To do this, I started by adding the SDK to my native iOS project. From there, results were then sent to the Apptimize dashboard, where I'll be able to **determine which option ended up a user favourite based on user retention and engagement**.
